WY Data was excluded from the analysis because the target age group varies over time, resulting in highly variable data. However, the data is still available in the Github file. We note the following discrepancies when analyzing the data. 2018-19 data collects 2 MMR data from 6-year-olds, state average MMR rate is 71%. School years 2019-20, 2020-21, and 2021-22 collect data for 7-year-olds, where the state averages are 72%, 76%, and 76%, respectively. 2022-23 data reports 2 MMR for Kindergarteners, where the state average is 91%. Immunization rates are obtained from the Wyoming Immunization Registry (WyIR), except for the 2022-23 Kindergarten rates, which are obtained from the 2022 Immunization Status Report. Note, the WyIR tends to underestimate true adoloscent coverage because  actual vaccines administered is often under-reported, as documented here: https://health.wyo.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/WDH-IMM_Immunization-Data-Technical-Notes-Rev..pdf",45782
